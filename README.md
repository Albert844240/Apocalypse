Ultimate Apocalypse with Panic Mode
Description

This script is a controlled chaos simulator for your Windows laptop.
It opens multiple pop-up windows with random sizes, positions, colors, and flashing text.
Each batch plays an alert sound. You can control the number of pop-ups or stop them using hotkeys.

⚠️ Warning: The script can generate many pop-ups quickly. Use the panic mode hotkey if needed.

How to Run

Save the script as UltimateApocalypse.bat (see instructions in script comments).

Double-click the .bat file to start.

You will see two warning popups first. Click Yes to continue.

After a 10-second countdown, the pop-ups start appearing.

Hotkeys
Hotkey	Action
Ctrl + Alt + S	Stop safely
Ctrl + Alt + U	Increase popups by 1
Ctrl + Alt + D	Decrease popups by 1
Ctrl + Alt + M	Max out popups to 10
Ctrl + Alt + P	Panic mode: instantly close all popups
Notes

The script only affects your laptop’s screen.

If the pop-ups become overwhelming, use Ctrl + Alt + P immediately.

For testing, you can adjust $maxPopups and $batchDelay in the script to control intensity.
